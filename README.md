Easy Setup: Just copy-paste into a new Colab notebook and run. No installations needed since it uses standard Python libraries.
Interactive Widgets: People can use dropdown menus, sliders, and text inputs instead of typing code. The interface updates in real-time.
Template System: Comes with three main templates (sitcom, football, cooking) pre-loaded, but people can customize everything.
Simple Workflow:

Choose template
Add custom characters (optional)
Add custom events to pools (optional)
Generate chaos with title/event count/chaos level controls

The widgets make it accessible to non-coders while still being infinitely customizable. 
Load the cooking template, add "The Refrigerator" as a mechanical character, throw in some custom disruptions like "ingredients achieve sentience," and immediately start generating their own kitchen dystopia.
