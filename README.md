## What is it?
The Universal Chaos Engine is a creative tool that generates random combinations of characters, actions, and events to create entertaining scenarios. Think of it as a story generator that works by mixing and matching elements you provide.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)
1. **Choose a Template**: Click one of the template cards (Sitcom, Football, Cooking, etc.) to load pre-made characters and events
2. **Go to Generate tab**: Click "Generate" at the top
3. **Hit the big button**: Click "UNLEASH THE CHAOS ENGINE" 
4. **Read the chaos**: Watch as random combinations create unexpected scenarios

## How it Works
The engine follows a simple pattern for each event:
- Character + Action → Disruption → Someone Shouts → Optional Bonus Chaos

## Customizing Your Engine

### Step 1: Characters (Actors tab)
- Add characters with names, roles, and styles
- Styles determine what kinds of actions characters can do
- Example: "Gordon Ramsay" with "explosive" style might "flame the dish"

### Step 2: Event Pools (Event Pools tab)
- **Primary Actions**: What characters do ("declares bankruptcy", "finds a secret")
- **Disruptions**: What goes wrong ("server crashes", "soufflé collapses")
- **Shouts**: What people yell ("IT'S RAW!", "This changes everything!")
- **Bonus Chaos**: Extra random events ("The WiFi becomes sentient")

### Step 3: Settings (Generate tab)
- **Number of Events**: How many scenes to generate (1-20)
- **Chaos Level**: How often bonus events happen (0-100%)
- **Title**: Name for your generated scenario

## Creative Applications

### For Writers
- Use "Character Conflict", "Plot Twist", "Dialogue Spark" buttons for writing prompts
- Load your actual character names to generate unexpected plot combinations
- Export outputs as text files for reference

### For Comedy
- Mix serious and absurd elements in your pools
- Higher chaos levels create more unpredictable combinations
- Try contrasting character styles (serious + silly)

### For Content Creation
- Generate scenario ideas for videos, sketches, or posts
- Create multiple variations to find the best combinations
- Save templates for different types of content

## Tips for Better Results

**Mix High and Low**: Combine serious elements with absurd ones. "The CEO declares bankruptcy while someone shouts about microwaving salads" is funnier than all serious or all silly.

**Character Chemistry**: Create characters with contrasting styles. A "melancholic" character and a "chaotic" one will create interesting combinations.

**Pool Balance**: Having 5-10 items in each pool gives good variety without being overwhelming.

**Chaos Tuning**: Start with 50% chaos level, then adjust based on whether you want more or less random bonus events.

## Troubleshooting

**Boring Output**: Add more variety to your pools, especially contrasting or unexpected items.

**Too Random**: Lower the chaos percentage or reduce the number of events.

**Repetitive**: Add more characters and pool items to increase combination possibilities.

**Not Your Style**: Try different templates or build completely custom characters and events.

## Advanced Features

- **Save Templates**: Export your custom setups as files to share or reuse
- **Multiple Variations**: Generate 5 different short versions at once
- **Writer's Block Busters**: Get targeted prompts for specific creative needs

The key is experimentation. The same framework that generates Kitchen Nightmares chaos can create serious writing prompts or corporate training scenarios just by changing the input pools.
